What is PySol ?
===============

PySol FC is an exciting collection of more than 1,000 distinct solitaire
card games - visit the PySol FC home page for more information:

What is PySol-Music ?
======================

A collection of additional background music adapted for use with PySol.
We are distributing this as its own package because we want to
keep the main distribution reasonably small.

PySol-Music should work with any PySol FC version.

PySol-Music is distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (GPL). The file COPYRIGHT in the data/music
directory contains additional information about the original authors.


How do I install the music ?
============================

Either
    copy the music songs to your PySol FC installation directory
        e.g. `cp -p data/music/* /usr/share/PySolFC/music/
or
    copy or move the music songs to your ~/.PySolFC/music/ directory
        e.g. `cp -p data/music/* ~/.PySolFC/music/'

Windows and Mac users might prefer using a filemanager for this ;-)

That's all - start PySol FC and enjoy.


Have fun,

    The PySol FC developers.
