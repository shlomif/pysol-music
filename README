What is PySol ?
===============

PySol is an exciting collection of more than 250 distinct solitaire
card games - visit the PySol home page for more information:

    http://pysol.tsx.org

What is PySol-Music ?
======================

A collection of additional background music adapted for use with PySol.
I'm distributing this as its own package because I want to
keep the main distribution reasonable small.

PySol-Music should work with any PySol version >= 4.30.

PySol-Music is distributed under the terms of the GNU General
Public License (GPL). The file COPYRIGHT in the data/music
directory contains additional information about the original authors.


How do I install the music ?
============================

Either
    copy the music songs to your PySol installation directory
        e.g. `cp -p data/music/* /usr/share/pysol/4.30/music/
or
    copy or move the music songs to your ~/.pysol/music/ directory
        e.g. `cp -p data/music/* ~/.pysol/music/'

Windows and Mac users might prefer using a filemanager for this ;-)

That's all - start PySol and enjoy.


Have fun,
Markus
